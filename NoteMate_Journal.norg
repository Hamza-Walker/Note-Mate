** 2025-04-25 Friday: 
** ( ) &TODO's&: 
*** ( ) *Initiate NoteMate*: 
    You've successfully set up a Python project with an object-oriented modular architecture—quite different from
    the component-based approach in Next.js, but with some conceptual parallels. Let me explain what we've created:
    1. ,Project Structure Overview,
    What you're looking at is a Python package organized into logical modules following the OOP architecture from your document:
    @code bash
    .
    ├── .git/               # Git repository (same as in TypeScript projects)
    ├── core/               # Core interfaces and models (like "types" or "interfaces" in TS)
    ├── note_scanner/       # Module for scanning note files (a separate "feature" module)
    ├── sync/               # Calendar synchronization logic (another feature module)
    ├── template/           # Template generation module (another feature module)
    ├── utils/              # Utility functions 
    ├── main.py             # Application entry point 
    ├── poetry.lock         # Dependency lock file 
    ├── pyproject.toml      # Project configuration 
    └── venv/               # Virtual environment (similar to node_modules, but includes Python)
    @end

    2. ,dependencies installed with pertry,: 
    *click* for CLI building
    *pydantic* for data models
    *SQLAlchemy* for database ORM
    *Jinja2* for templating
    *textblob* for spell checking
    *APScheduler* for task scheduling
    *ics.py* and *Google API* client for calendar syncing
    3. ,Scaffolded the module structure, : 
    Added directories that correspond to the OOP design in your document, preparing for implementation of different components
* ( ) re-Initiate NoteMate: 
  decided to go for lua instead of heavy python scripting
  notemate will be a plugin managed through lazy and loaded into nvim 
  the directory set up has been initialized. 

  @code bash 
  notemate.nvim/
  ├── plugin/
  │   └── notemate.lua      # Auto-loaded at startup
  ├── lua/
  │   └── notemate/         # Main plugin code
  │       ├── init.lua      # Entry point
  │       ├── core/         # Core functionality
  │       │   ├── event_bus.lua
  │       │   ├── models.lua
  │       │   └── db.lua
  │       └── features/     # Feature modules
  │           ├── note_scanner/
  │           │   └── parser.lua
  │           ├── sync/
  │           │   └── calendar.lua
  │           └── template/
  │               └── generator.lua
  └── README.md

  @end

** Key Files to Implement First
   - *lua/notemate/core/event_bus.lua* - Your event system 
   - *lua/notemate/features/note_scanner/parser.lua* - Implement the note parser that extracts tasks from your notes format
   - *lua/notemate/features/sync/calendar.lua* - Port your existing Apple Calendar scripts to this module

** set up proper tools for lua development:
   how to read and handle errors ? 
   - (x) installed :Trouble to handle errors in lua 

   major Progress: 
** commit message 1:
   feat: Initial plugin structure and task management core

   - Created Neovim plugin structure with proper directory layout
   - Implemented core Task model for representing tasks from notes
   - Added simple Event Bus for module communication
   - Developed note scanner/parser to extract tasks from buffer
   - Prepared Apple Calendar integration structure
   - Added Neovim commands for scanning tasks and calendar sync
   - Set up symlinks for local plugin development

   This commit establishes the foundational architecture for the Notemate
   plugin, following a modular design with event-driven communication. 
   The plugin can now parse tasks from note files in format:
*** ( ) &TASK_2&: *Moodle Support*: [15:00-17:00]

    Files:
    - lua/notemate/core/models.lua
    - lua/notemate/core/event_bus.lua
    - lua/notemate/features/note_scanner/parser.lua
    - lua/notemate/features/sync/calendar.lua
    - plugin/notemate.lua
    - lua/notemate/init.lua

** commit message 2: 
   feat: Implement core task parsing and calendar integration

   - Added Task model for representing structured tasks
   - Created note scanner that extracts tasks from buffer using pattern matching
   - Implemented Calendar integration via AppleScript
   - Set up simple Event Bus for component communication
   - Added Nvim commands (:NotemateScan, :NotemateSync)

   This commit provides the foundation for parsing tasks from notes in the 
   format: "*** ( ) &TASK_2&: *Title*: [HH:MM-HH:MM]" and syncing them to 
   Apple Calendar. The next phase will add database persistence and 
   bi-directional sync capability.

   Testing:
   - Verified task parsing from test notes
   - Successfully synced tasks to Apple Calendar
   - Commands registered and working as expected
